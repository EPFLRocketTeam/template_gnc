# template_gnc
A template package for GNC projects, following the architecture defined in the package [real_time_simulator](https://github.com/EPFLRocketTeam/real_time_simulator).

This template should serve as a starting point for every new GNC project. It already contains all the proper interfaces between the GNC nodes and the simulator, as well as some basic implementations of each GNC algorithm.

You can directly use this package as is, or modify each algorithm as you need it.
