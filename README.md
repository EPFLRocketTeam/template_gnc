# basic_gnc
Simple GNC algorithms to be used as example/template for the real time simulator

Install the package in your catkin workspace, and compile with catkin_make

Launch a simulation using these GNC algorithms 
```bash
roslaunch basic_gnc basic_SIL.launch
```

Visualize the result of the simulation
```bash
roscd real_time_simulator/postProcess/
python postProcess.py
```
